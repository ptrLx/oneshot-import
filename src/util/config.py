disclaimer = """This tool imports images from past dates into your OneShot diary.
To get started, copy the images into the 'image' folder where the tool was started (or specify a path with '-p <path>').
Make sure to copy only one image per day. Otherwise you will get asked which picture to choose (OneShots will always be preferred over other images).
Start with '--auto' to let the importer choose an image.

A 'import-me.json' file will be generated, which can be imported in the OneShot-App.

⚠️🚨 Be aware that all images must be renamed to the OneShot naming schema 🚨⚠️
